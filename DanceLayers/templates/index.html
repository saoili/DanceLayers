        Inspired by Julie Brown's excellent solo class at The Spoonful 2016. The idea here is to explore combinations of movement that you might otherwise not do.
        <br>
        Play some blues, get used to each 'layer' and then add another.
        <br>
        They're randomly generated from a predefined list, so some of the combinations may be impossible. Just hit refresh to get a new one. Enjoy!
        <br>
        <br>
        Start with your {{first[0]}}: {{first[1]}}<br>
        Add {{second[0]}}: {{second[1]}}<br>
        Then add {{third[0]}}: {{third[1]}}
        <br>
        <br>
